# Bad news are good news!? - Quantitative Text Analysis of German News Headlines

## Introduction

The world has faced multiple crises in the last decade, including the migration crisis starting in 2015, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Ukraine War. Hence, there is a large amount of negative news in terms of its content. Besides, due to the growth in user-tracking technologies throughout the 2010s to measure content reach, it has become a common fact that ``Bad news are good news``, which means that negative headlines reach more clicks/ attention. Therefore, in this project we analyse folowing question: 

                  Have outlets started to drift towards increasing usage of negative sentiment in their headlines to make even good/ neutral news (in terms of its content) sentimentally more negative?

In order to find answers to this question, we applied several quantitative text analysis approaches, which is represented in following figure:

## Data
### Collecting Data
For our analysis, we collected in total 548,629 ${\color{violet} 548,629 \space German \space news \space headlines}$ over a ``10-year time frame`` (01.01.2013 to 30.04.2023) from ``8 different news outlets`` and ``8 different categories``:

We used [MediaCloud.org](https://search.mediacloud.org/search?) to collect the headlines for the outlets **bild.de** and **Spiegel**. Due to the fact that Mediacloud API has an API request/rate limit, we downloaded the headlines as csv file manually from their webside. Headlines for the other **outlets** are not available on MediaCloud and therefore we scraped them directly from the outlets archive websides using [WebScraper.io](https://webscraper.io/) (Google Chrome Extension). In the following a sample SiteMap for scraping the headlines for the outlet **SZ** in category **Digitalisierung** is shown:

```markdown
{"_id":"DigitalisierungSueddeutsche","startUrl":["https://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/page/[1-97]?search=Digitalisierung&sort=date&all%5B%5D=dep&typ%5B%5D=article&sys%5B%5D=sz&catsz%5B%5D=alles&time=2013-01-01T00%3A00%2F2013-06-19T23%3A59&startDate=01.01.2013&endDate=31.12.2018","https://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/page/[1-97]?search=Digitalisierung&sort=date&all%5B%5D=dep&typ%5B%5D=article&sys%5B%5D=sz&catsz%5B%5D=alles&time=2013-01-01T00%3A00%2F2013-06-19T23%3A59&startDate=01.01.2019&endDate=31.12.2021","https://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/page/[1-25]?search=Digitalisierung&sort=date&all%5B%5D=dep&typ%5B%5D=article&sys%5B%5D=sz&catsz%5B%5D=alles&time=2013-01-01T00%3A00%2F2013-06-19T23%3A59&startDate=01.01.2022&endDate=30.04.2023"],"selectors":[{"id":"Title","parentSelectors":["_root"],"type":"SelectorText","selector":"em.entrylist__title","multiple":true,"regex":""},{"id":"Date","parentSelectors":["_root"],"type":"SelectorText","selector":"time","multiple":true,"regex":""},{"id":"URL","parentSelectors":["_root"],"type":"SelectorLink","selector":"a.entrylist__link","multiple":true}]}
```

In figure \ref{img:headlinesDataset} a description of the variables in the dataset are given and in figure \ref{img:ExampleHeadlines} three sample observations of the dataset are shown.

#### Human Coding




This foolder contains the headlines datafile, which includes 548,629 headlines from 8 different German news outlets in 8 different categories from 01.01.2013 to 30.04.2023.
Roughly 2% (11,109) were labeled manually into Negative and NotNegative: 
Negative NotNegative 
6546        4563 
#### Naive guess

In order to be able to evaluate our models, we perform human coding of about 2\% (11,109) of the headlines. We, randomly chose 2\% of the observations, and a team of 7 family members coded the headlines into \textbf{Negative} or \textbf{NotNegative}. We labeled the headlines according to the maximum coding\footnote{e.g., if 5 coded the headline as Negative and 2 as NotNegative, we assigned NotNegative}. We labeled the data according to the sentiment rather than the content of the headline. I.e., if a headline contains negative content but is expressed in positive/ neutral language, it is classified as NotNegative. Note that otherwise, it would be very hard to classify headlines because human (political) opinion would be included\footnote{E.g., a headline about Covid-19 lockdowns could be classified differently according to the opinion of the coder}. A full list of guidelines and sample codings are provided in appendix \ref{appendix:1}. In total, 6546 (~59\%) headlines were classified as Negative; 4563 (~41\%) were classified as NotNegative.

\subsubsection{Naive guess}
When analyzing performance statistics of our statistical models, we have to get an idea of what a specific value of accuracy means. When we predict a headline as Negative without using any model, one reasonable guess would be to use the mean outcome of the data\footnote{the naive guess is the most common outcome of the dependent variable = the human coding}. In our case, roughly 59\% of the headlines are Negative, which means that even by making the simplest possible guess, we would get an accuracy of 0.589252.

### Scraping full article
Additionally, for the **text-scaling analysis** of the political ideology of the news outlets, we used the packages ``rvest`` and ``xml2`` in R to collect **full news articles** from two categories in specific time frames:
- **Homo Ehe** (26.06.2017 - 10.07.2017)
- **Bürgergeld** (01.09.2022 - 08.01.2013)

In the following the function to scrape an article from the outlet **Wirtschaftswoche** is shown:

```markdown
getWirtschaftsWoche <- function(url) {

  #read the url
  htmlPage <- read_html(url)
  
  #identify all nodes with text
  textNodesAll <- htmlPage %>% xml_find_all('//p') 
  
  #identify elements, we don't need
  textNodesRemove1 <-  html_elements(htmlPage, ".c-leadtext")
  textNodesRemove2 <-  html_elements(htmlPage, ".modalwindow__ctext")
  textNodesRemove3 <-  html_elements(htmlPage, ".modalwindow__footer-caption")
  textNodesRemove4 <-  html_elements(htmlPage, ".modalwindow__cpt")
  textNodesRemove5 <-  html_elements(htmlPage, "em")
  
  #now remove unwanted elements
  textNodes <- textNodesAll[!(textNodesAll %in% textNodesRemove1)]
  textNodes <- textNodes[!(textNodes %in% textNodesRemove2)]
  textNodes <- textNodes[!(textNodes %in% textNodesRemove3)]
  textNodes <- textNodes[!(textNodes %in% textNodesRemove4)]
  textNodes <- textNodes[!(textNodes %in% textNodesRemove5)]
    
  #convert elements to text
  textP1 <- textNodes[1:(length(textNodes)-1)] %>% xml2::xml_text()
  
  #get string of last entry
  textp2 <- textNodes[length(textNodes)] %>% xml2::xml_text()
  #now remove all "em" text only if we fouond any em's
  if (length(textNodesRemove5) > 0) {
    for (i in 1: length(textNodesRemove5)) {textp2 <- wwRString(textp2, textNodesRemove5[i] %>% xml2::xml_text())}
  }
  
  #remove header
  textFinal = paste( textP1[2:(length(textP1))], textp2)
  
  #collaps all text together in one single string
  final <- paste(textFinal,collapse= " ")
  
  return(final)
} 
```
The R code to scrape articles for all otlets can be found [here](https://github.com/NadineNicoleSchmitt/Analyzing-German-News-Headlines/blob/main/WebScraping/scrapeArticles.R). 
> __Note__ As we do not want to have each article as an *individual* document, we **collapsed** the data to the **outlet level** (i.e. we have one single document for each outlet). The collapsed articles for each outlet are then stored in a dataframe ([articlesHomoEhe.Rdata](https://github.com/NadineNicoleSchmitt/Analyzing-German-News-Headlines/blob/main/Data/articlesHomoEhe.Rdata), [ariclesBuergergeld.Rdata](https://github.com/NadineNicoleSchmitt/Analyzing-German-News-Headlines/blob/main/Data/articlesBuergergeld.Rdata)).

## Word Embeddings

### Compare two Pearson correlations
In order to compare two Pearson correlations the [cocor package in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cocor/cocor.pdf) is used. It can be downloaded from the [project's homepage](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cocor). 
The follwoing command is typed into the R console to install the cocor package in R:
```markdown
install.packages("cocor", lib= "/my/own/R-packages/")
library("cocor")
``` 
Subsequent to the above steps, the cocor package can be used to compare two Pearson correlations. It is done for a _dependent overlapping group_ by using following function in R (see the [R script](https://github.com/Nadine-Schmitt/bachelorThesis-nadischm/blob/master/Code/cocor.Rmd)):
```markdown
cocor.dep.groups.overlap(r.jk, r.jh, r.kh, n, alternative = "two.sided", test = "all", alpha = 0.05, conf.level = 0.95, null.value = 0, data.name = NULL, var.labels = NULL, return.htest = FALSE)
```
where following arguments as input are required: 
- **r.jk** is a number specifying the correlation between j and k (this correlation is used for comparison). 
- **r.jh** is a number specifying the correlation between j and h (this correlation is used for comparison).
- **r.kh** is a number specifying the correlation between k and h.
- **n** is an integer defining the size of the group.
- **alternative** is a character string specifying whether the alternative hypothesis is two-sided ("two.sided"; default) or one-sided ("greater" or "less", depending on the direction).
- **test** is a vector of character strings specifying the tests (pearson1898, hotelling1940, hendrickson1970, williams1959, olkin1967, dunn1969, steiger1980, meng1992, hittner2003, or zou2007) to be used. With "all" all tests are applied (default).
- **alpha** is a number defining the alpha level for the hypothesis test. The default value is 0.05.
- **conf.level** is a number defining the level of confidence for the confidence interval (if test meng1992 or zou2007 is used). The default value is 0.95.
- **null.value** is a number defining the hypothesized difference between the two correlations used for testing the null hypothesis. The default value is 0. If the value is other than 0, only the test zou2007 that uses a confidence interval is available.
- **data.name** is a character string giving the name of the data/group.
- **var.labels** is a vector of three character strings specifying the labels for j, k, and h (in this order).
- **return.htest** is a logical indicating whether the result should be returned as a list containing a list of class htest for each test. The default value is FALSE.

Illustrating this, an example of the comparison between the two Pearson scores for Similarity353 for the best models with parameter setting (300,3,5,1,0,16) is shown in the following. As output from the training and evaluation a Pearson score of 0.786 for the raw model and 0.793 for the entity embedding is the result. As also the intercorrelation between the two correlations is needed as input parameter, the correlation between the cosine similarities of the raw model with the cosine similarities of the entity model is computed and given as 0.012. Besides, the Similaritym353 dataset has a size of 203 instances. Therefore following need to be typed in to the R command line in order to compare the two Pearson correlations:
```markdown
cocor.dep.groups.overlap(r.jk= 0.786, r.jh= 0.793, r.kh= 0.012, n=203, alternative="two.sided", alpha=0.05, conf.level=0.95, null.value=0)
````
As output all results of the tests are shown and the null hypothesis is for this example always retained:

All the calculated results can be seen on the [excel files](https://github.com/Nadine-Schmitt/bachelorThesis-nadischm/tree/master/Results/ResultsCocor).
